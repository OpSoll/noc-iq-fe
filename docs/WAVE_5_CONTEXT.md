# Wave-Level Reliability Governance Framework

This document tracks backend engineering metrics boundaries required for production deployment authorizations.

## Scoring Index Criteria Matrix
The system health calculation uses a multi-faceted index formula to balance code stability and active operational metrics:

$$\text{Reliability Index} = (\text{SLO} \times 0.40) + (\text{Tests} \times 0.30) + (\text{Security} \times 0.20) + (\text{Incidents} \times 0.10)$$

## Release Block Conditions
A release candidate will receive an automatic **NO-GO** status if:
1. The combined `Reliability Index` drops lower than **85.0**.
2. Any unmitigated, open vulnerability regressions exist inside core runtime dependencies.
